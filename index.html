      <h1>Gill's Problems</h1>
      <p>
        Our beloved friend and cumin Gillian faces many problems in her life. One of the biggest problems that she faces on a day to day basis is the insane number of incompetent people she must deal with on a regular basis. Here is a compilation of the most recent articles from the New York Times containing the word "value" so that we can add more value to her life to make up for the incompetent people who detract. Who knew that incompetence was such a national problem? We sure didn't.
